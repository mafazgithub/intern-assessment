# Internship Assessment

## Workings and thought process



Identified issues with standard events in modals, prompting the exploration of a `MutationObserver`. Faced limitations with the `MutationObserver` approach, leading to the adoption of a timer-based solution.

 Implemented a timer to periodically check for content changes, allowing for a more reliable response. Prioritized adjustability by making the timer interval tunable, accommodating diverse page dynamics. Rigorously

 tested the implementation to ensure consistent responses to dynamic content. Ensured code efficiency by adopting a concise and clear design. Embraced an iterative thought process, learning and adapting the 

solution based on observed behaviors. Addressed broader aspects like event management and modular, scalable design. Future-proofed by designing for scalability and potential UI integrations.
