## Workings and thought process
The automation script is designed to streamline user interactions on a web page. It automatically opens a reactions modal and smoothly scrolls down to the bottom when triggered, ensuring a polished user experience. 

The script's operation involves event handling to recognize user actions, such as clicking designated buttons. Once triggered, it orchestrates the opening of the reactions modal and employs a `scrollDownToBottom` 

function for a refined scrolling animation. Additional features include example automations and executing specific ones, enhancing versatility. The development process focused on overcoming challenges, refining 

scrolling behavior, and ensuring seamless integration with existing web page structures. The script aims to provide an efficient and user-friendly enhancement to web page interactions.
